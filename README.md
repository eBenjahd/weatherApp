# Weather Forecast App (Frontend Demo)

This project is a **frontend-only demonstration** application built to showcase UI development, state management, and API integration best practices.  
It is **not intended to be a production-ready application**, but rather a technical demo focused on frontend architecture and implementation.

## Purpose

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate:

- Component-driven UI development
- Data fetching and caching
- Clean styling architecture
- Type-safe React code

There is **no backend owned by this project**. All data is fetched from an external public API.

## Tech Stack

- **React + TypeScript (TSX)** – Component-based UI with strong typing
- **React Query (@tanstack/react-query)** – Server-state management, caching, and async handling
- **Axios** – HTTP client for API requests
- **SCSS** – Modular and scalable styling
- **Vite** – Fast development environment

## Features

- Hourly and daily weather forecast UI
- Custom dropdown and keyboard navigation
- Fully responsive layout
- Accessible focus states and keyboard interactions
- Clean separation of logic, UI, and utilities

## Project Scope

This application focuses **only on the frontend layer**:

- No authentication
- No database
- No server-side logic
- No persistent state

It is intended to demonstrate **frontend skills and architectural decisions**, not full-stack functionality.

## Disclaimer

This project is a **demo project for learning and portfolio purposes**.  
API data, edge cases, and error handling are simplified.

## License

This project is open for educational and demonstration purposes.


## 🌐 Deployment

The application is deployed using **Vercel**, providing fast global delivery and an optimized frontend hosting environment.
